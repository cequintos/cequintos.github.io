## About Me

Hello, I am Carlos Quintos, I was born on November 2, 2002 in Peru and I live in Barcelona, Spain.

I am currently a technician in network computer systems administration and I am studying to have a specialization in cybersecurity.

I was once a "distro hopper" (on Linux), I like playing with virtual machines, managing operating systems and learning about open source software.
